# Dstructs
Welcome to the complete Data Structure package.  DSTRUCTS are a set
of data structures in the following languages.

1. C
2. C++
3. Go
4. Java
5. JavaScript
6. Python
7. Ruby
8. Rust
9. TypeScript

Given that there are **numerous** data structures there will be quite a bit of code located
in this package.  I wish I had to time to get them all but I will focus mostly on the
common data structures.  To aid the organization of this I group the data structures into
sections.
1. **Lists**
   - Array List
   - Linked List
   - Stacks (Implemented via Array List and Linked List)
   - Queues (Implemented via Array List and Linked List)
2. **Trees**
   - AVL Tree
   - Binary Search Tree
   - Binary Tree
   - B-Trees
   - Heap
   - Binary Heap
   - Binomial Heal
   - Merkle Tree
3. **Hashes**
   - Hash Table
   - Hash Tree
   - Bloom Filter
4. **Graphs**
   - Graph
   - Adjacency List
   - Directed Graph
5. **Sorting**
   - Simple Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Merge Sort
   - Heap Sort
   - Quick Sort
   - Shell Sort
   - Bubble Sort
   - Comb Sort
   - Counting Sort
   - Bucket Sort
   - Radix Sort
6. **Searching**
   - Linear Search
   - Binary Search
   - Jump Search
   - Interpolation Search
   - Exponential Search
   - Lasso Search (My invention!!)

**Disclaimer**

I am an engineer **NOT A COMPUTER A SCIENTIST** so I tend to have programming habits that drive
Computer Scientists crazy.  I have been trying over the years to heed their advise and
warnings and improve the way I code but I know I am not there completely.  So with that
being said, I absolutely appreciate criticism and advice on how to program better.
