# Dstructs
Welcome to the complete Data Structure package.  DSTRUCTS are a set
of data structures in the following languages.

1. C
2. C++
3. Go
4. Java
5. JavaScript
6. Python
7. Ruby
8. Rust

Given that there are **numerous** data structures there will be quite a bit of code located
in this package.  I wish I had to time to get them all but I will focus mostly on the
common data structures.  To aid the organization of this I group the data structures into
sections.
1. **Lists**
   - Array List
   - Linked List

2. **Trees**
  1. AVL Tree
  2. Binary Search Tree
  3. Binary Tree
  4. B-Trees
  5. Heap
  6. Binary Heap
  7. Binomial Heal
  8. Merkle Tree

3. **Hashes**
  1. Hash Table
  2. Hash Tree
  3. Bloom Filter

4. **Graphs**
  1. Graph
  2. Adjacency List
  3. Directed Graph

5. **Sorting**
  1. Simple Sort
  2. Insertion Sort
  3. Merge Sort
  4. Heap Sort
  5. Quick Sort
  6. Shell Sort
  7. Bubble Sort
  8. Comb Sort
  9. Counting Sort
  10. Bucket Sort
  11. Radix Sort

6. **Searching**
  1. Linear Search
  2. Binary Search
  3. Jump Search
  4. Interpolation Search
  5. Exponential Search
  6. Lasso Search (My invention!!)

**Disclaimer**

I am an engineer **NOT A COMPUTER A SCIENTIST** so I tend to have programming habits that drive
Computer Scientists crazy.  I have been trying over the years to heed their advise and
warnings and improve the way I code but I know I am not there completely.  So with that
being said, I absolutely appreciate criticism and advice on how to program better.
