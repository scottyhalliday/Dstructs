NOTE:  I am an engineer (Computer and Electrical).  I mention this because
I know many Computer Scientists and many have often commented that engineers
tend to program in "non-elegant" ways.  I am always striving to become a better
programmer and am open to criticism and advice to reach that goal.  If there
are any areas you feel could be better written please feel free to correct me.
