The data structure package is organized into the different core Data

NOTE:  I am an engineer (Computer and Electrical).  I am by no means
a purist Computer Scientist.  As an engineer I need to create solutions
and while I can do that, I don't guarantee the most elegant code.  I will
provide comments and assumptions so that it is hopefully clear what I
am attempting to do.  Please feel free to propose more elegant solutions
as I am a humble person and greatly appreciate constructive feedback.
