# Stack
## C Array List Implmentation

This implementation of a stack is done using an array list.  The stack uses a fixed size.  If the size of the stack
is exceeded then an error is thrown and the item is not added.  The implementations allow a stack of a specific type
to be created.
1. Integer
2. Double (Floating-Point)
3. String

A stack can only consist of a single data type and cannot use combinations.
