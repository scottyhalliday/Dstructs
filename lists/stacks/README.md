# Stacks

Stacks are more a less a list with some very specific rules.  A stack works on the 
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.  As with most things in computing, there is 
more than one way to implement things.  The issue becomes for which situation is one
way better than the other.

Therefore, the stack is implemented in two ways:
1. Array-based Stack
2. Linked-List-based Stack

Of course each has their pros and cons, but this will give an idea how each performs
