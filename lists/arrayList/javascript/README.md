# JavaScript Implementation of Array List Data Structure

The ArrayList is a fixed array-based list which can store any data type
(consistent data type).  Since JavaScript is an untyped language the three supported
data types can coexist in a single implementation.  There is an option in the code
to keep data types strict.
The features implemented for this data structure are described below.
1. Create the list.  List is initialized to empty state
2. Determine whether the list is full
3. Determine whether the list is empty
4. Find the size of the list
5. Destroy/Clear the list
6. Determine whether an item is the same as a given list element
7. Insert an item in the list at a specified location
8. Remove an item from the list at a specified location
9. Replace an item at a specified location with another item
10. Retrieve an item at a specified location
11. Search the list for a given item

Using the installed nodejs interpreter the code can be run as follows:

```bash
node arrayList.js
```

This implementation was tested using nodejs v8.12.0
