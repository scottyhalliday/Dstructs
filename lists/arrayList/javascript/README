ARRAYLIST
By Scott Hall

This implementation of ArrayList was done using Javascript.

Models an array list for fixed or mixed value types.  The list will not allow
duplicate entries nor will it dynamically resize the ArrayList size.  The
methods include the follow:
o  Create the list.  List is initialized to empty state
o  Determine whether the list is full
o  Determine whether the list is empty
o  Find the size of the list
o  Destroy/Clear the list
o  Determine whether an item is the same as a given list element
o  Insert an item in the list at a specified location
o  Remove an item from the list at a specified location
o  Replace an item at a specified location with another item
o  Retrieve an item at a specified location
o  Search the list for a given item

This implementation was tested using nodejs v8.12.0
