ARRAYLIST DATA STRUCTURE
~Scott Hall

This directory contains the various implementations of an Array List data
structure.  In a nutshell, the Array List data structure is designed to create
an array which can be populated with content.  The array list can be
constructed using three different data types, integer, float and string.
Scripting languages (i.e. Python, Ruby, etc.) allow dynamic typing so lists
can conceivably contain multiple different data types.  The ability to keep
the list data types strict (i.e. a single data type per list) is enabled.

Some of the core constraints of the data structure include, no duplicates and
the list is not ordered.  Each language's implementations are stand alone
meaning there are no other Dstructs packages required.  Each language supports
the three main data types integers, floats and strings.  Each implementation
comes with a brief testing script to see how its usage goes.  If the
implementation is a compiled language then a makefile will be provided.
