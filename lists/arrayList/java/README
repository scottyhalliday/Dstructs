ARRAYLIST
By Scott Hall

The ArrayList is a fixed array-based list which can store any data type
(consistent data type).  The implementation in Java uses the Generics feature
to allow single piece of code but usable for different datatypes.
The features implemented for this data structure are described below.
    o  Create the list.  List is initialized to empty state
    o  Determine whether the list is full
    o  Determine whether the list is empty
    o  Find the size of the list
    o  Destroy/Clear the list
    o  Determine whether an item is the same as a given list element
    o  Insert an item in the list at a specified location
    o  Remove an item from the list at a specified location
    o  Replace an item at a specified location with another item
    o  Retrieve an item at a specified location
    o  Search the list for a given item

To test this implementation simply use the makefile by entering 'make' in the
terminal and it will compile.  Then using the java just-in-time compiler you
can run it the code with 'java ArrayList'
