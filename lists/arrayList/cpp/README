ARRAYLIST
By Scott Hall

The ArrayList is a fixed array-based list which can store any data type
(consistent data type).  This implementation of ArrayList will dynamically
grow as the list fills.  The growth will always be the double of the list
size at the time it reaches its full state.  The features implemented for
this data structure are described below.
    o  Create the list.  List is initialized to empty state
    o  Determine whether the list is full
    o  Determine whether the list is empty
    o  Find the size of the list
    o  Destroy/Clear the list
    o  Determine whether an item is the same as a given list element
    o  Insert an item in the list at a specified location
    o  Remove an item from the list at a specified location
    o  Replace an item at a specified location with another item
    o  Retrieve an item at a specified location with another item
    o  Search the list for a given item
    o  Resize the array
