ArrayList
By Scott Hall

This implementation of the ArrayList data structure is done in Python.  As we
all know Python is extremely forgiving and can handle dynamic and inconsistent
data types within a list structure.  This implementation uses the built-in
Python list and its features to create an ArrayList.  In keeping with Python's
dynamic data typing this implementation will allow an ArrayList to contain
different data types within the structure (int, float and str)

The features implemented for this data structure are described below.
    o  Create the list.  List is initialized to empty state
    o  Determine whether the list is full
    o  Determine whether the list is empty
    o  Find the size of the list
    o  Destroy/Clear the list
    o  Determine whether an item is the same as a given list element
    o  Insert an item in the list at a specified location
    o  Remove an item from the list at a specified location
    o  Replace an item at a specified location with another item
    o  Retrieve an item at a specified location with another item
    o  Search the list for a given item

To view the small test suite connected to this program simply launch
arrayList.py with your Python3 interpreter.

    python3 arrayList.py

I used Python 3.6.6 for this development.
