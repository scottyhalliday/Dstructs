# Python Implementation of Array List Data Structure

The ArrayList is a fixed array-based list which can store any data type
(consistent data type).  Since Python is a duck typed language it can handle
different data types within a structure.  This uses Python's built-in list
and its features to implement array lists.  This implementation will allow
an array list to contain multiple data types and leaves it to the user to 
change this feature if he/she should desire.  The features implemented for 
this data structure are described below.
1. Create the list.  List is initialized to empty state
2. Determine whether the list is full
3. Determine whether the list is empty
4. Find the size of the list
5. Destroy/Clear the list
6. Determine whether an item is the same as a given list element
7. Insert an item in the list at a specified location
8. Remove an item from the list at a specified location
9. Replace an item at a specified location with another item
10. Retrieve an item at a specified location
11. Search the list for a given item

To view the small test suite connected to this program simply launch
arrayList.py with your Python3 interpreter.

```bash
python3 arrayList.py
```

I used Python 3.6.6 for this development.

TODO:
Clean up camel case and convert it so that it uses underscores.
