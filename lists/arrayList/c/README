ARRAYLIST
By Scott Hall

The ArrayList is a fixed array-based list which can store any data type
(consistent data type).  The implementation in C which means that to support
different datatypes, separate implementations for each datatype needed to be
created.  Supported datatypes are int, double and string.
The features implemented for this data structure are described below.
    o  Create the list.  List is initialized to empty state
    o  Determine whether the list is full
    o  Determine whether the list is empty
    o  Find the size of the list
    o  Destroy/Clear the list
    o  Determine whether an item is the same as a given list element
    o  Insert an item in the list at a specified location
    o  Remove an item from the list at a specified location
    o  Replace an item at a specified location with another item
    o  Retrieve an item at a specified location
    o  Search the list for a given item

To test this implementation simply use the makefile by entering 'make' in the
terminal and it will compile and generate the '<type>arrayList' executable.
It can also be compiled in 'debug mode' by entering 'make debug' in the
terminal.  This will create an executable able to be passed to various
debugging tools such as Valgrind.

Compiled against gcc 7.3.0
